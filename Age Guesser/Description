# Guessing Age with API 

Welcome to my Jupyter Notebook project focused on guessing a person's age based on their name and country using an API. In this notebook, I leverage the power of APIs to access a specialized service that utilizes advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to provide estimated age ranges.

By inputting a person's name and country, this interactive notebook demonstrates how APIs can be harnessed to retrieve relevant data and leverage machine learning models to make educated guesses about individuals' ages. Through this project, I showcase my proficiency in integrating APIs, handling data requests, and utilizing external services to extract meaningful insights.
